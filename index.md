# A command line build tool

I built capt to help me build single page apps. Tools like Jammit are great for when you're working in a rails environment, but I found there weren't any really good tools for building apps that are standalone, for example couchapps, or standalone javascript apps that use XMPP or access a javascript api.

Imagine you're building the new twitter interface, capt is designed to build something like that.

## Alpha release!

Capt has been under development since November '10, but it's still very alpha, expect things to be missing / broken.

## Ignoring .js and .css directories

Add `.js/` and `.css/` to your `.git/info/exclude` file. This will ignore all the hidden .js and .css files that are generated by capt.

## Create app structure

Run `capt new project` to create a project directory. Capt will creates the necessary files to get you up and running and will download the latest jQuery / backbone.

## Compiles .jst templates

You specify what your static html is going to look like as a `.jst` file, and capt will compile your index.html. You can include the following lines:

    <%= project.stylesheetIncludes() %>
    <%= project.scriptIncludes() %>

This will include seperate javascript files (in the correct dependency order) in development mode, or compile them all to one minimized file in production mode.

## Serves your app

You can start an express-powered webserver on port 4000 using:

    capt server

## Serves your jamine specs

By default your app will have a `/spec/` directory that includes jasmine and an index.jst. When you create new models, you should create a spec for them in `/spec/models/` and capt will add them to your spec runner. Run the specs by browsing to `http://localhost:4000/spec/`.

## Manages dependency order and autoloads

Specify files in `config.yml`. The default config.yml looks like this:

    javascripts:
      - 'lib/jquery.js'
      - 'lib/underscore.js'
      - 'lib/backbone.js'
      - 'lib/coffeescript.js'
      - 'lib/less.js'
      - 'app/controllers/*.coffee'
      - 'app/views/**/*.coffee'
      - 'app/models/*.coffee'

    stylesheets:
      - 'public/stylesheets/*.less'
  
    specs:
      - 'spec/*/*.coffee'

Add files to each section to specify build order. Files will only be included once. For example:

    javascripts:
      - 'app/models/mybaseclass.coffee'
      - 'app/models/*.coffee'

# Installation 

Installation requires [npm](http://npmjs.org/), then:

    npm install capt
